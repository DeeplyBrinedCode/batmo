Main repository for ECEGR 2000 final project.

Plan:
Make an RC car that can detect obstacles.

Setup:

Servo Connections:

GND to GND (Pin 6)

Vcc to 5V (Pin 4) or to 3V (Pin 1)

S1 to GPIO14 (Pin 8)

S2 unconnected

Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Connections:

GND to GND (Pin ?)

Vcc to 3V (Pin ?) *Eliminates need for voltage divider, but decreases range from 100cm to 84cm

Echo to GPIO24 (Pin ?)

Trig to GPIO23 (Pin ?)
